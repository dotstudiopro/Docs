# Objects


# Create Objects in DotstudioPRO SDK

1. SPLTCompanyData : This is singleton Objects & is used to fetch all company data. 
2. SPLTCategory : This is Dotstudio Category Object. It have all metadata of Dotstudio Category & Also it contains Dotstudio Channel objects.
3. SPLTChannel : This is Dotstudio Channel Object. It have all metadata of Dotstudio Channel & Also it contains Dotstudio Video objects.
4. SPLTVideo : This is Dotstudio Video Object. It have all metadata of Dotstudio Video.

SPLTCompanyData : Below method will fetch all the categories & it will return in its delegate callback.
```swift
SPLTCompanyData.sharedInstance.getCategories()
```

SPLTCategory : Below method will fetch category metadata & its channels. Below code will fetch featured category metadata & channels which are added on featured category.
```swift
let featuredCategory = SPLTCategory()
featuredCategory.strSlug = "featured"
featuredCategory.loadCategory(completion: @escaping (_ categoryDict: [String: Any]) -> Void, completionError: @escaping (_ error: NSError) -> Void)
```


SPLTChannel : Below method will fetch channel metadata & its videos. Below code will fetch featured channel metadata & videos which are added on featured channel.
```swift
let featuredChannel = SPLTPlaylistChannel()
featuredChannel.strSlug = "featured"
featuredChannel.loadFullChannel(_ completion: ((_ channelDict: [String: Any]) -> Void)?, completionError: ((_ error: NSError) -> Void)?)
```

Note that in above example we created object of SPLTPlaylistchannel instead of SPLTChannel. In DotstudioPRO SDK we have SPLTChannel as base class.
There are 3 types of channels. SPLTVideoChannel, SPLTPlaylistChannel & SPLTMultiLevelChannel. Main base class for all of this is SPLTChannel.
When you load channel from category it will either be of SPLTVideoChannel, SPLTPlaylistChannel or SPLTMultilevelChannel.

a. SPLTVideoChannel. : As name suggests, SPLTVideoChannel is a single video channel which will have only one video.
b. SPLTPlaylistChannel : SPLTPlaylistChannel is a video playlist channel & it will contain array of videos.
c. SPLTMultilevelChannel: SPLTMultilevelChannel is a Parent channel which will contain multiple child channels those can be either SPLTVideoChannel or SPLTPlaylistChannel.


SPLTVideo : Below method will fetch video metadata.
```swift
let spltVideo = SPLTVideo()
spltVideo.strId = "video-id"
spltVideo.loadFullVideo(_ spltChannel: SPLTChannel?, completion: @escaping (_ videoDict: [String: Any]) -> Void, completionError: @escaping (_ error: NSError) -> Void)
```
