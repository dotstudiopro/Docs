# Screens


# DotstudioPRO SDK comes with some predefined screens configuration which helps to quickly finish up UI by inherting & using storyboard & xibs to configure User interface.

1. SPLTBrowseViewController : This ViewController represents Home screen & displays all the home screen categories & its playlist videos or channels in a rail or featured carousel.
2. SPLTCategoriesViewController : This ViewController represents all the categories in a grid format.
3. SPLTCategoryViewController : This ViewController represents one category & its channels of it.
4. SPLTMylistViewController : This ViewController represents all the mylist channels of users & management of mylist channels can be done here.
5. SPLTSearchViewController : This ViewController represents search screen & it can handle channel or video search.
6. SPLTIVPMultiseriesChannelTableViewController : This ViewController represents a single channel screen which handles all the different types of channels in same screen.

Note that all above ViewControllers needs to be inherited to generate User interface from storyboard & xibs.
